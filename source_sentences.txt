U.N. group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by unruly posturing and mutual recriminations -- gained renewed focus Friday with the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhouse-gas reductions over the next 40 years , with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the near term .
The text , which could provide the basis for a final political deal to regulate greenhouse gases , highlighted the remaining obstacles as much as it illuminated a path forward .
But it was seen as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time , with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week .
Forged by a U.N. ad-hoc working group , the text is silent on how much money rich countries would give poor ones to cope with global warming over the short and long term .
And it provides a range of options for the key questions , including how developed and major emerging economies would cut their carbon output , and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate .
It gives a lot of flexibility to the process , said John Coequyt , senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club .
Michael Zammit Cutajar , who drafted the six-page document , boiled down a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the U.N. 's top climate official , Yvo de Boer , described as `` the big picture . ''
It shows the outlines for a possible deal , in which industrial nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels , while major developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent .
Together , the countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050 .
The European Union gave the talks a boost as well on Friday by pledging to provide $ 3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- from coping with flood and drought to avoiding deforestation .
Still , Friday featured the same sort of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks for the past week .
U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of greenhouse-gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary ones by major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world .
The move signaled that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago .
The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries stepping up and taking action , said Stern , who also complained that the text did not do enough to make sure the cuts could be verified by outside observers .
Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese vice foreign minister He Yafei said America 's top climate negotiator was either lacking `` common sense '' or being `` extremely irresponsible '' for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming .
With the future economic trajectory of the world 's major powers at stake , fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies .
The current battle is as much about saving individual economies as saving the planet , with China and United States feuding over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the world 's two dozen most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action .
Ricardo Ulate , a Costa Rican delegate , said it 's not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs for curbing greenhouse gases , even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big emitters accountable for their actions .
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed , said Ulate , who also serves as the regional Mexico and Central America climate change adviser for Conservation International .
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen , although most of the major participants say the talks will produce a political deal at best .
The Alliance of Small Island States , which has 43 members , produced a 24-page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning .
Artur Runge-Metzger , who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission , said the push by small island nations has `` put political pressure on the entire political process , '' in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India .
The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government arrive to strike a deal .
High-level officials such as Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister stepped off planes and raced through the Bella Center 's halls to closed-door meetings and news conferences so they could stake out claims that will be arbitrated over the next week .
The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day , guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out , and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses a challenge .
The intensity is only building : nearly all of the key ministers are now here , and as early as Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen .
We 're getting into the big leagues , said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez , vice president for global policy at Conservation International .
The heavyweights are coming .
Baskonia gives away a victory in Israel
Caja Laboral achieved a stunning 82-91 victory on their visit to the Maccabee Electra court despite Dusko Ivanovic 's team 's heavy losses , and after the great performance by Mizra Teltovic , who was the best on his team with eight three-pointers scored ( 29 points ) , they now at the top of their group .
The Vitorian team knew to make up for the significant absences of Herrmann , Oleson , Huertas and Micov with a big dose of involvement and teamwork , even though it had to hold out until the end to take the victory .
Additionally , their huge success from the sidelines , with 16 three pointers scored , had a lot to do with the final triumph .
The game started out in favor of the Azulgranas , who put themselves ahead on the scoreboard from the start .
As Vitora 's first four baskets were from the perimeter , the speculation was already that they had jumped into the Israeli net with hot wrists .
English and Teletovic were the main scorers of the 18-20 at the end of the first period .
The second quarter was more of the same , but the Alavan team opted for the inside game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu , who was greeted with whistles and applause at his return home , to continue increasing their lead by half-time ( 34-43 ) .
Teletovic had already begun to stand out as the best on his team with 13 points , even though Splitter 's `` six fewer '' points already signaled that it was n't going to be the best night for the Brazilian .
But the game , despite being headed for halftime , was not more decidedand the Maccabees tried to remind the Vitorians that not just anybody wins on their court , and with the ` hand of Elias ' putting the pressure on , they managed to get involved in the game .
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in the `` yellows ' '' return to the light .
More disadvantages
Ivanovic 's players , injured but far from dead , needed to run a couple of plays correctly before they could breathe , and that 's when the machine gun Marza Teletovic arrived , with three almost consecutive three-pointers and the help of English and Ribas , he brought the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead ( 54-67 ) , which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter ( 57-67 ) .
The Alavas worked themselves to the bone in the last period , and English and San Emeterio ( 65-75 ) had already made it clear that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes .
However , Pnini and Eidson , the best on their team , did not give up and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line ( 70-77 ) .
In spite of this , and with Splitter fouling out , Ivonic 's team did n't rush , defended well , and , even though the Israelis came close at the last minute , the game was already won and victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season .
Wall Street closes without momentum , slowed by a strengthening dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed with no particular heading on Friday , in a market torn between better than expected indicators in the United States and a strengthening dollar : the Dow Jones gained 0.63 % but the NASDAQ dropped 0.03 % .
According to final closing figures , the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10 471.50 points , whereas the NASDAQ , with a technology predominance , fell by 0.55 point to 2 190.31 points .
The wider Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 has itself advanced by 0.37 % ( 4.06 points ) to 1 106.41 points .
Frankly , the market is very calm , observes Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management .
It remains within a narrow margin ; trading volumes have become very weak , and I think that this will remain the case until the end of the year .
The trend was supported by the publication of better than expected economic indicators , which `` have contributed to improving market opinion in relation to the robustness of the economic recovery '' , summarised Charles Schwab 's analysts .
In the United States , retail sales have increased by 1.3 % in November , for the second month in a row , and far more than predicted .
Moreover , the confidence of American consumers has clearly bounced back in December , to 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month , according to preliminary estimates from Michigan University 's index .
The indices have , however , been slowed by a renewed rise of the dollar , to a new two-month high against the Euro , which `` puts downward pressure on the sectors that are sensitive to the economic situation '' , explained Owen Fitzpatrick from Deutsche Bank .
Technology securities have thereby lost some ground .
Treasury 10-year bond yields have grown to 3.540 % against 3.482 % on Tuesday evening , and 30-year bond yields are at 4.497 % against 4.492 % the previous evening .
Iraqi Oil Ministry reaches deals with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability , the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its ailing infrastructure during two auctions that concluded Saturday .
The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China , Russia and European oil firms are poised to play a major role in refurbishing Iraq 's oil industry , crippled by decades of war and sanctions .
American companies walked away with stakes in just two of the 10 auctioned fields .
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction , which began Friday .
The only one that submitted a bid lost .
Two American companies reached deals for fields auctioned in June .
The meager representation of American oil giants in Iraq 's opening oil industry surprised analysts .
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war , and instead of U.S. companies , you have Asians and Europeans leading the way , said Ruba Husari , the editor of Iraq Oil Forum , an online news outlet .
It will be a long time before anything else will be on offer in Iraq .
Concerns over security , underscored by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday , and political instability as the U.S. military withdraws , likely kept American oil companies from venturing more forcefully in Iraq , which has the world 's third-largest proven crude reserves , analysts said .
U.S. firms were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals , particularly the Chinese and other government controlled energy firms , have markedly lower labor costs and are more prone to take risks because they do n't respond to shareholders .
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that reached deals with the ministry .
Major U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips , which have cultivated close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years , walked away empty-handed .
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top stakeholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend .
State-owned China National Petroleum Corporation bid on more contracts than any other company and walked away with large stakes in contracts for two major fields .
We all know that China is on track to become a major economic as well as technological power , Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said .
We feel confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments towards Iraq .
Companies pre-selected to submit bids made offers that were then compared to the per barrel fee the ministry was willing to pay for boosting output above current levels at each field .
US banks repay state support
The crisis-hit US major banks are breaking free from their state shackles .
On Wednesday Bank of America repaid the support from the bank protection fund TARP in the amount USD 45 billion ( nearly EUR 30 billion ) in one go .
And , according to reports from US broadcaster CNBC , Citigroup is also planning to repay the state support .
The institutions thereby want to wiggle themselves free from the restrictions going hand-in-hand with the acceptance of the money , such as the limits on manager bonuses and the paying of high charges .
Bank of America had raised some USD 19 billion from investors through convertible loans .
The rest of the amount was taken from its own kitty , which was well filled through the sale of business units .
Bank head Kenneth Lewis extended his express thanks to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening : The cash injection helped over a very difficult time .
The bank overstretched at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch .
Citigroup also plans to raise cash on the capital market to free itself from its liabilities with the state .
Already on Thursday , the US bank was able to announce a capital increase of some USD 20 billion , reported CNBC with reference to circles .
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment .
Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their support in June .
Cheshire Appeal Will Point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them typing away in the courtroom rows .
Minute by minute , they sent out reports of gruesome testimony via Twitter .
In the end , the defense says , there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the trial that dealt with rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set ablaze .
On Thursday , the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes , who was convicted of killing three members of a Cheshire , Conn. , family , is set to come to an official end with the judge 's imposition of the death sentence voted for by the jury .
But lawyers for Mr. Hayes have already made court filings that sketch out appeals arguments that are likely to occupy the courts for years .
One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters ' extensive use of Twitter - created a `` circus atmosphere '' and such widespread , instant saturation with inflammatory details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions .
The claim could force appeals judges to grapple with the question of whether new technology requires new courtroom rules .
`` As I experienced it during this trial , I think there 's a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is affecting an individual 's fair-trial rights , '' said Thomas J. Ullmann , Mr. Hayes 's chief defense lawyer .
The trial judge , Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court , tersely rejected the claims in a ruling last week , saying that the news media were `` carefully controlled '' and that there was no evidence the jury was driven by passion .
But that is not likely to be the last word on the issue .
For decades , appeals courts have recognized that coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about a trial 's fairness .
In a landmark 1966 ruling , the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath , Dr. Sam Sheppard , for the murder of his wife , saying in its decision , Sheppard v. Maxwell , that there was a `` carnival atmosphere at trial '' because of the news media .
The crime is believed by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the movie `` The Fugitive . ''
Some lawyers said appeals courts reviewing Mr. Hayes 's conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules could be necessary to govern ways of communicating from courtrooms unimagined at the time of Dr. Sheppard 's case .
`` There is a general reason for concern about the impact of the new media '' in high-profile trials , said John J. Donohue III , a Stanford Law School professor who studied the Connecticut death penalty and wrote a report that said it was arbitrarily enforced .
Professor Donohue said some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms might make trials fairer .
The Twitter issue is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes 's lawyers that are likely to be argued for years , delaying an execution .
The defense lawyers also claim , for example , that Mr. Hayes may have been prejudiced when Judge Blue declined to allow them to test potential jurors ' reactions by showing them grisly crime-scene photographs during jury selection .
Some of the jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims , Jennifer Hawke-Petit , 48 , and her daughters , Hayley , 17 , and Michaela , 11 .
The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge wrongly removed a juror who had been critical of prosecutors and that he improperly added pressure for a verdict by his unusual decision to direct the jury to deliberate over a weekend .
The jurors were not sequestered .
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the trial may draw the most interest .
They noted in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate .
They argued that the news media continually fanned the flames of emotion about the case .
`` The daily crush of media tweets , cameras and reporters outside the courthouse , '' the lawyers wrote , `` was unlike anything ever seen here in New Haven and maybe statewide . ''
Their focus on the Twitter coverage is controversial .
In interviews , some journalists said the claim that instant news was more incendiary than reports delivered more slowly was a Luddite view that would make poor court policy governing coverage of future trials .
But some lawyers said appeals courts were often attracted to arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts .
Mr. Hayes 's lawyers are pressing that claim .
In their filing , they referred to the Supreme Court 's 1966 decision overturning Dr. Sheppard 's conviction because of the trial coverage and made it clear they would claim that the new media required new rules .
`` This case , '' they wrote , `` represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century . ''
Sport and fraud law
Tricks such as those of Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax demonstrate wittiness but not the will to get remove of a sanction .
The expulsion presumably forged by two players of Real Madrid ( Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos ) in the game played on the 23rd of November against Ajax in European Champions League has caused rivers of ink to be written about if such behavior is or is not unsportsmanlike and if , both players should be sanctioned by UEFA .
As we all know , a few minutes before the end of the game ( that their team had already won ) , both players deliberately wasted time which made the referee show the second yellow card to both of them .
This way , and since Real Madrid will finish as leader of its group , both players will fulfil the prescribed sanction during the next game of league , against Auxerre , and will be able to get rid of the cards the following phase .
Finally , the committee of discipline of the UEFA has sanctioned with two games the trainer of the team , Jose Mourinho , and with different economic amounts the implied players .
The provocation of a yellow card in similar circumstances as this one is not a new practice , but rather frequent in the world of football .
It is so extended that it part of the ethos , of the unwritten rules , but followed nonetheless by this sport .
Part of the debate arisen in the related case is caused by the fact that has been carried out by team of the Real Madrid organization ( that in its hymn presumes of nobility and honor , and that has fined its players for analogous acts ) and by the dramatization orchestrated , apparently , by Mourinho , who adds one more to his expanded history of histrionic and provoking technician .
Anyway , the debate deals with if that type of behavior not prohibited specifically by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport , that is to say , if with these actions fraud is committed ; then , indeed , they are respectful actions with the sport regulation , but they seem to elude its sense .
The matter examines the type of damage that is brought to the sporting spirit .
One of the advantages that include the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players , aspect that with these actions was n't put into danger , that is to say , there was no violent game .
Another of these advantages to which it is alluded to with the fare-play is to avoid that the team of the lawbreaker players takes advantage unjustly of the opposite team , which did not happen either .
However , the paradoxical thing about the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it did not comply to what we normally characterize as legal fraud , because the violation of the rules was not made secretly as to try to avoid the sanction , but their action was most evident and thus they received punishment from the referee .
They waited for and accepted the sanction with no complaints .
Another question is what type of advantage the violators obtained in the actions deliberately carried out .
Here it seems necessary to state that it is n't a disadvantageous situation for rival nor is an obtained benefit in the same game , because evidently the result of the action supposes leaving their own team with less players .
And neither is it a useful strategy for the next game , because the club will not be able to count on those players .
The advantage , obviously , consists in the fact that the players will begin the following phase of the Championship without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game .
But it is about a long term advantage , with a certain degree of indetermination , because the team can be eliminated first of change , and in addition with this action the players fulfil a sanction game and go to the second cycle of cards , in which the suspension by card accumulation takes place with one less than in the first cycle .
So that , by passing rounds , it is not so clear that it is an advantage .
Those actions are really against the sporting spirit , which is part of the strategic decisions that favor taking advantages allowed by the rules .
Regarding this assumption , the players did not act in order to avoid the application of the sanction ( this would have been a clear case of legal fraud ) , but rather chosen when to obey it .
They made a strategic decision without avoiding the punishment .
Although the border between the wittiness and the law fraud is diffuse , in this occasion I believe it was a clear case of wittiness .
The controversy seems to arise from two factors : because it was about two auto expulsions and the way the transmission of the directive was carried out to cause them .
The damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic .
Arsenic-tolerant microbe raises possibility of new types of life on Earth , or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients widens the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond .
While researchers discovered the unusual bacteria here in Earth , they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential .
`` This organism has dual capability . ''
`` It can grow with either phosphorus or arsenic . ''
`` That makes it very peculiar , though it falls short of being some form of truly ` alien ' life , '' commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University , a co-author of the report appearing in Thursday 's online edition of the journal Science .
Six major elements have long been considered essential for life - carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and sulfur .
But the researchers found that the bacteria , discovered in Mono Lake , Calif. , is able to continue to grow after substituting arsenic for phosphorus .
`` It makes you wonder what else is possible , '' said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University , a co-author of the report .
The find is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life , to know what life looks like , Anbar said .
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth .
However , the announcement of a news conference to discuss it , which did not disclose details of the find , generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report would disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life .
The discovery `` does show that in other planetary environments organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the ` standard ' set of elements we think are absolutely necessary for life might not be so fixed , '' commented Charles Cockell , professor at Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute , Open University , in Milton Keynes , United Kingdom .
Cockell was not part of the research team .
`` This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure , '' added Cockell .
It was n't a chance discovery .
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA 's Astrobiology Institute , who led the study , targeted Mono Lake because it has high arsenic levels .
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar , so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both might be able to substitute one for the other .
`` Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is so similar to that of phosphorus . ''
`` As a result , organisms have a hard time telling these elements apart . ''
`` But arsenic is different enough that it does n't work as well as phosphorus , so it gets in there and sort of gums up the works of our biochemical machinery , '' explained Anbar .
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic , which it was able to adapt to and grow .
The microbe does grow better on phosphorus , but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form using arsenic could occur naturally , either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common .
Jamie S. Foster , an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida , said the idea that arsenic could be substituted for phosphorus is n't new , but there has never been example where it was shown to work .
Arsenic was more common in the early times on Earth , she said , so researchers have speculated that early life forms might have used it .
`` It does suggest that that there could be other ways to form life , not just how life formed on early Earth , '' said Foster , who was not part of Wolfe-Simon 's research team .
The research was supported by NASA , the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health .
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to edge up , as does backing for private enterprise .
Crime has become a bigger worry than unemployment .
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States across much of the region .
Those are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist .
Because the poll has been taken regularly since 1995 , it tracks changes in attitude across the region .
Two related things stand out in the results of this year 's poll , taken in September and early October .
The first is Latin America 's fairly sunny mood .
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its core institutions .
Support for democracy has risen noticeably in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America ( see table 1 ) .
For example in Peru , where economic growth has averaged 6 % a year since 2002 , support for democracy has risen from a low of 40 % in 2005 to 61 % this year .
It also rose in Mexico , where the economy has recovered after suffering a big drop in output last year .
But only around half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil , the region 's two most populous countries , are convinced democrats , which drags down the regional average ( see chart 2 ) .
Some 44 % of respondents across the region pronounced themselves satisfied with how their country 's democracy works in practice , the same figure as last year but a big increase on the 25 % in 2001 ( chart 3 ) .
Some 34 % said they had confidence in their country 's Congress and 45 % in their government , the same as last year in both cases but up sharply from 2003 ( 17 % and 24 % respectively ) .
A decade ago economic woes in Latin America undermined support for democracy .
That it has held up during the world financial crisis is probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a brief recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery .
In addition , a stronger social safety net has helped to shield the poor .
( The United Nations ' Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year , to 32 % . -RRB-
But the mood varies widely from country to country ( see chart 4 ) .
Brazil 's strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president , Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva , is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress .
That is scarcer in Mexico and Central America , where the recession was more severe and violent crime has worsened .
For only the second time since the polls began , more respondents across Latin America as a whole cite crime , rather than unemployment , as the most important problem facing their country ( see chart 5 ) .
Some 31 % say that either they or a close relative have been victims of crime over the past year , but that is down from 38 % last year and is the lowest figure since 1995 .
A more robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy : some 71 % of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development , up from 56 % in 2007 ( see chart 6 ) .
Some 58 % agree that the market economy is the only system that will make their country developed , up from 47 % last year .
Interestingly , 62 % of respondents in Venezuela hold that view ( and 80 % there back private enterprise ) even though their left-wing president , Hugo Chávez , is expropriating many private companies .
Brazil is the country which exercises most leadership in the region , mentioned by 19 % of respondents ( up from 18 % last year ) , followed by the United States ( 9 % , unchanged from last year ) and Venezuela ( 9 % , down from 11 % last year ) .
But the United States is seen as the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America , whereas Venezuela enjoys that distinction in Ecuador , the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua .
Scalia and Thomas dine with healthcare law challengers as court takes case
The day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether it would hear a challenge to President Obama 's healthcare law , two of its justices , Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas , were feted at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will argue the case before the high court .
The occasion was last Thursday , when all nine justices met for a conference to pour over the petitions for review .
One of the cases at issue was a suit brought by 26 states challenging the sweeping healthcare overhaul passed by Congress last year , a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists nationwide .
The justices agreed to hear the suit ; indeed , a landmark 5.5 - hour argument is expected in March , and the outcome is likely to further roil the 2012 presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time the court 's decision is released .
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be Paul Clement , who served as U.S. solicitor general during the George W. Bush administration .
Clement 's law firm , Bancroft PLLC , was one of almost two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society , a longstanding group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles .
Another firm that sponsored the dinner , Jones Day , represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law , the National Federation of Independent Business .
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc , which has an enormous financial stake in the outcome of the litigation .
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court 's conference over the case .
In attendance was , among others , Mitch McConnell , the Senate 's top Republican and an avowed opponent of the healthcare law .
The featured guests at the dinner ? Scalia and Thomas .
It 's nothing new : The two justices have been attending Federalist Society events for years .
And it 's nothing that runs afoul of ethics rules .
In fact , justices are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal justices .
If they were , they arguably fell under code 's Canon 4C , which states , `` A judge may attend fund-raising events of law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker , a guest of honor , or featured on the program of such an event . ''
Nevertheless , the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case , as well as to a company with a massive financial interest , was enough to alarm ethics-in-government activists .
`` This stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code belies claims by several justices that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , '' said Bob Edgar , the president of Common Cause .
`` The justices were wining and dining at a black-tie fundraiser with attorneys who have pending cases before the court . ''
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any claims of impartiality , and is unacceptable .
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agenda-driven groups such as the Federalist Society .
And Thomas '' wife , Ginni , is a high-profile conservative activist .
Moreover , conservatives argue that it 's Justice Elena Kagan who has an ethical issue , not Scalia and Thomas .
Kagan served as solicitor general in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial court level .
Her critics have pushed for Kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case , saying that she was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now .
Kagan has given no indication she will do so .
The familiarity of the Spanish is higher than that of the Ticos
Of the 22 players called in Spain , ten passed 50 international games .
On the side of Costa Rica only one of 22 called players reached 50 games .
A minor contrast to Costa Rica , comparing the 22 players called by both countries for the friendly game today , at 3:05 pm at the National Stadium in San Jose .
While the Europe and world champions , number one one in the monthly top of FIFA , have a long record of Class A inter selection , the Tricolor has only the defender Michael Umana as the only one who has 50 international games .
That number was reached Friday before the game against Panama ( 0-2 ) , in Rommel Fernandez .
Spanish football players playing in the All-Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England are during the year very active in league and local cup competitions and there are high-level shocks in the European Cups and European Champions League .
To this is added the Spanish Fury experience in complicated qualifications for Euro Cup and World Cup .
The Ticos players , however , have a limited international experience in an area such as CONCACAF , which is considered the lowest level within FIFA
We see that the peak of the Spanish selection is the goalkeeper Iker Casillas , who last Saturday against England ( game lost with 0-1 in London ) equaled the record of the ex goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta , with 126 international matches .
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will impose a new record of 127 international matches for Spain .
Xavi Hernandez , the player of Barcelona , has 106 matches .
Casillas and Xavi were recognized last week by UEFA together with the other player of the Iberian team , Zubizarreta with 126 matches and Schalke striker Raul Gonzalez with 102 .
Almost near the centennial number is Carles Puyol , with 97 games .
On Costa Rican side , and close to Michael Umana , are the left-lateral Junior Diaz , with 48 matches and the striker Bryan Ruiz , with 45 .
After this , only five exceeded the 30 games : Keilor Navas with 31 , Randall Azofeifa with 32 , Michael Barrantes with 31 , Carlos Hernandez with 36 and Jose Luis Lopez with 35 .
More than 30 matches in Spain have Gerard Piqué ( 37 ) , Sergio Busquets ( 36 ) , Santiago Santi Cazorla ( 32 ) , Alvaro Arbeloa ( 31 ) and Raul Albiol ( 31 ) .
On the national side , with less than 30 presences , there are Roy Miller with 26 , Winston Parks with 26 , Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23 .
The rest does n't come near the 20 .
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two , in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder did not debut yet .
The leading scorer of Spain is David Villa is , with 50 goals , followed by Fernando Torres with 27 .
For Costa Rica , Bryan Ruiz is the one that registers more points , two more than Carlos Hernandez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks .
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy ?
Immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised from various aspects a congestion of police , legal and administrative services subjected to a policy of numbers and the compatibility of that policy with the self-proclaimed status of the country as the country of French human rights .
More recently , it is administrative harassment of foreign students , which is topical , with the minister of the interior ( `` Libération '' on 23 May ) declaring that France `` does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . ''
But it is only rarely analyzed from the economic viewpoint .
There is a lot of consensus between the Left and the Right on this subject .
On the Right , the tone was set by Jacques Chirac , who declared in 1976 that `` 900,000 unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 2 million of foreign workers , '' and on the Left by Michel Rocard explaining in 1990 that France `` can not accommodate all the world 's misery . ''
The only difference , the degree of generosity
In 2005 , the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was felt both on the Left and on the Right .
Both sides see immigrants as a burden on the French economy and on French society .
The only difference resides in the degree of generosity , which one deigns to grant to immigrants .
In his program , François Hollande confines himself to banalities , saying that co-development would allow our immigration problem to be solved . ''
This notion of immigration being a burden and a problem , may be an electoral asset , but it is economically very costly .
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron , remind us in a recent book summarising the most recent knowledge of immigration ( Exceptional People : How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future , mai 2011 , Princeton University Press , 352 pp . ) , there is wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , wages and employment in countries , which admit immigrants .
Restraining immigration leads to anaemic growth and harms employment .
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the notion that they are liable to replace native workers , in particular unskilled ones , exerting downward pressure on wages .
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are much more complementary to , rather than replacements of , local labor , exercising trades in which there is a shortage of local labor .
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labor and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where training does is not linked to offers of employment .
A positive effect on wages
In the same way as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists , the complementarities existing between locals and immigrants bring it about that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the pay of locals .
Giovanni Peri has calculated that a rise of 1 % in the migratory flow causes an increase of between 0,6 and 0,9 % in real long-term pay .
And does so without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth ( a large proportion of naturalised immigrants are among American Nobel prize winners , whilst Google , Intel , Paypal , eBay and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants ) .
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems , averaging 1 % of the total budgets of European countries .
The World Labor Organisation estimates that for example in Germany , an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 , will make a net contribution ( receipts less expenditure ) of an average of 150,000 Euros to public budgets during his lifetime .
Nicolas Sarkozy wished at the start of his mandate to look for missing points of growth `` with the teeth . ''
The teeth in question , intended to serve to dissuade immigrants , had precisely the opposite effect .
Deutsche Bank pays multi-million pound fine in the USA
Fresh trouble is following hard on the heels of the uproar around Josef Ackermann , CEO of Deutsche Bank : Deutsche Bank faces a multi-million pound fine in the USA .
As if the problems at home were not already enough for Deutsche Bank , the industry giant 's past in the USA is now also catching up with it . Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank will pay 145 million dollars ( 106 million Euros ) to settle disputes arising from the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis .
The issue centres on the sale of mortgage securities .
The National Credit Union Administration ( NCUA ) , a financial market regulator , accuses a string of major banks of having used false promises to mislead credit unions into buying the financial products .
The value of the securities dropped dramatically during the financial crisis and brought down the credit unions .
`` We are happy to have resolved the issue without the parties going to court , '' said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York .
The bank did not admit culpability in the settlement .
The same is true of Citigroup , which agreed to pay 20.5 million dollars .
The NCUA chairman , Debbie Matz , welcomed the responsiveness of the two banks .
The National Credit Union Administration ( NCUA ) is responsible for the US credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcies to protect customer deposits .
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for losses that run into the billions .
The current settlements are the first of their kind .
The regulator had also approached other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase , the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer .
The dubious mortgage securities are so-called mortgage-backed securities .
This sealed the fate of a number of financial companies when the US property bubble exploded in 2007 .
The US investment bank , Lehman Brothers , went belly-up in September 2008 at the height of the financial crisis .
The banks battling against a strong wind in the USA several years later .
Investors and regulators have brought a vast number of claims for compensation or to punish misconduct .
The Federal Housing Finance Agency ( FHFA ) has been behind the largest wave of claims .
It accuses 18 major international banks of having taken in US lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on mortgage transactions valued at around 200 billion dollars .
Deutsche Bank also faces legal action by the FHFA covering multiple transactions with a total value of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007 .
The regulator is demanding that the Frankfurt-based bank take responsibility for `` substantial losses , '' but has not yet specified the exact sum .
Deutsche Bank has rejected the claims as baseless and has declared its intention to fend off the claims .
